# 🧩IoT-Scanner
A multi‑stage IoT network scanning and device‑response framework designed to discover, analyze, and eventually isolate IoT devices based on behavior, protocols, and risk level.

---

## 📌 Overview

**IoT‑Scanner** is an experimental tool that currently focuses on **network scanning only**.  
The idea behind the project is to build a flexible IoT security framework over time, starting with basic device discovery and expanding into deeper analysis and automated responses.

This project began as a personal technical experiment — not a formal research study — and it grows through trial, error, and continuous improvement.

---

## ⚠️ Project Status

The project is **not perfect**, still evolving, and may contain bugs, missing features, or non‑optimal logic.  
It should be considered a **work‑in‑progress**, not a finished or production‑ready tool.

At the moment, only the **network scanning phase** is implemented, including:

- ARP‑based device discovery  
- ICMP probing  
- Basic SNMP enumeration  
- MAC vendor lookup  

More advanced features will be added gradually.

---

## 🌐 Vision & Scope

IoT devices behave differently depending on vendor, firmware, communication style, and purpose.  
Because of this, the long‑term vision of IoT‑Scanner is to become a **general‑purpose IoT security engine** that adapts to each device individually.

The framework aims to eventually understand:

- normal vs abnormal behavior  
- device roles inside the network  
- communication patterns  
- risk levels  
- how each device should be handled  

This repository is only the **starting point** of a much larger idea.

## 🛡️ Isolation & Response Concept (Future Goal)

A major future direction of the project is **adaptive isolation**, where the tool may:

### Soft Isolation  
Restrict a suspicious device inside the same network while monitoring it.

### Hard Isolation  
Completely block or quarantine a device that shows dangerous or malicious behavior.

### Remediation Attempts  
When possible, the tool may try to:

- limit harmful traffic  
- recommend fixes  
- provide warnings  
- attempt basic automated responses  

These features are experimental and extremely challenging, but they represent the long‑term goal of the project.

## 💬 Final Notes

This is only the beginning.  
The tool will grow, change, break, improve, and evolve — and that’s part of the journey.
